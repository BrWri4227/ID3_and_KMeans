# ID3_and_KMeans
My own rendition(s) of the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm as well as KMeans performed on the iris dataset.

### Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
The Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm is a simple algorithm that is used to build decision trees. The algorithm is based on entropy and information gain calculations. The ID3 algorithm is used to classify data into classes by building a decision tree.

### KMeans
The KMeans algorithm is a simple algorithm that is used to cluster data into groups. The algorithm is based on the Euclidean distance between data points and cluster centroids. The KMeans algorithm is used to group data into K number of clusters.

### Iris Dataset
The iris dataset is a popular dataset that is used for classification and clustering tasks. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three classes: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Files
- `ID3.py`: Contains the implementation of the ID3 algorithm.
- `KMeans.py`: Contains the implementation of the KMeans algorithm.
- `iris.data`: Contains the iris dataset.
- `Node.py`: Contains Leaf Node structure for tree building
- `Vector.py`: Contains information about each flower

### Requirements
   - Python 3.x
